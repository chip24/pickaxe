A mechanical pencil or clutch pencil is a
pencil with a replaceable and mechanically
extendable solid pigment core called a
"lead" /ˈlɛd/. The lead, often made of
graphite, is not bonded to the outer
casing, and can be mechanically extended as its point is worn away as it is being used. The vast majority of 
mechanical pencils have erasers.

Other names include: microtip pencil, 
automatic pencil, drafting pencil, 
technical pencil, draughting pencil, click
pencil (generally refers to a specific
brand), pump pencil, leadholder, Pacer
(Australian English, ca. the 1980s),
propelling pencil (British and
Australian English, often refers to
higher-end mechanical pencils),[1]
pen pencil (Indian English), and
lead pencil (Bangladeshi and
American English).


Mechanical pencils are used to provide 
lines of constant width, without need of
sharpening, for tasks such as technical
drawing as well as for clean looking 
writing. They are also used for fine-art
drawing. Since they do not have to be
sharpened, they are also popular with
students. Mechanical pencils were
first used in the 18th century, with
many designs patented in the 19th
and 20th centuries.
